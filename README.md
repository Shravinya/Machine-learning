# Predictive Query Optimization Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict SQL query execution time and optimize execution plans in real-time. It helps improve the performance of database queries by analyzing query patterns, table sizes, join operations, and index usage, adapting dynamically to changing workloads.

The system uses a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict execution time based on features extracted from queries. It can suggest optimizations, such as using indexes, to minimize query execution time.

## Features

- Predict query execution time using machine learning.
- Optimize queries by suggesting index usage and other execution plan improvements.
- Adapts to changing workloads by learning from query execution patterns.
- Uses a **Random Forest Regressor** to train and predict query performance.
